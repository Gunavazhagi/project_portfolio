## KPMG Virtual Internship Project

The KPMG data analytics virtual internship is designed to provide practical insights into the work conducted at KPMG and offers an opportunity to build career skills and experience. 
**Problem Statement:**
                      Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has a list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes, but these customers have no prior transaction history with the company. The marketing team recognizes that this data holds valuable insights that could be leveraged to enhance their marketing efforts. 
However, the challenge lies in how to effectively analyze this data to identify high-value customers and optimize resource allocation for targeted marketing.


### Task 1: Data Quality Assessment

**Project Context:**
The primary goal of this assessment was to evaluate the quality of the data used in our project and identify issues that could impact its reliability and accuracy. We conducted a thorough assessment of three data sheets:

1. **Transactions Sheet:** [Provide details about this data sheet, such as its structure and size.]
2. **New Customer List:** [Describe this data sheet, including any challenges faced.]
3. **Customer Demographic:** [Explain the characteristics of this data sheet, including any inconsistencies encountered.]

**Data Quality Issues Identified:**
During the data quality assessment, several issues were identified:

- Null values were found in all three data sets.
- The "Product First Sold Date" column in the Transactions sheet was deemed irrelevant.
- Inconsistencies were observed in the "gender" column of the New Customer List.
- In the Customer Demographic sheet, inconsistencies were noted in columns such as "gender," "job title," and "job industry."

**Actions Taken:**
We addressed these data quality issues by implementing standardized options and data cleaning processes. We also communicated the findings to the client via email, providing a data quality assessment report for the KPMG internship project.

### Task 2: Data Exploration

**Project context**
The primary objective of this project was to develop an effective strategy for targeting high-value customers based on customer demographics and attributes. We aimed to help our client identify and engage with their most valuable customers to improve business outcomes.

1.Identify High value Customers
2. Segmenting and Targeting
3. Resource Allocation Optimisation
4. Performance Improvement

**Data Exploration Findings**

In addition to the tasks mentioned earlier, we conducted data exploration to gain deeper insights into the dataset. Here are the key findings from our data exploration:

## 1. Bike Related Purchase Over The Last 3 Years Based On Gender
Data shows that Females have made a substantial contribution to our sales, purchasing nearly 70,000 bikes. 
On the other hand, males have also shown strong engagement with our products, with approximately 68,000 bikes purchased during the same period.

## 2. Profit by Wealth Segment Across Age Clusters
The analysis reveals that the Financial Services, Manufacturing, and Health industries have emerged as the top profit-generating sectors in relation to bike purchases. 
These industries have exhibited significant revenue contributions, showcasing their strong alignment with our products.
The analysis indicates that the IT and Telecommunications industries have registered comparatively lower profit contributions in relation to bike purchases

## 3. Top Profit-Generating Job Industries in Relation to Bike Purchases
Data shows that the mass customer segmentation makes the highest profit across the different age clusters.
 Mass Customer aged between 41-50 are likely to bring more profit for the company compared to the other age clusters.
 This also indicates a trend of buying power, as the buying power increases over time till 50 and then see’s a decline in buying power, thus leading to lower profit

## 4. Profit Analysis Based on Brands
Data shows that the "WerareA2B" brand emerges as the top performer, yielding the highest profits.
“Solex” follows closely as the second-highest profit-earning brand. Its strong performance is indicative of its popularity and appeal among our customers.
While the "Norco Bicycles" brand registers the lowest profit margins.

## 5. Number of Owned Cars in Each State
New south wales, QLD & Victoria could be potential market opportunity for the company
 “New South Wales” has the highest potential as the number of people that own car is almost equal to the people who don’t own cars which shows that there is opportunity to find value customers there.

These data exploration findings provide additional insights into the dataset and can be valuable for decision-making and strategy development.

### Task 3: Data Visualization:

**Project Context**
This project aims to create a dashboard that will help our client specify their target customers within their customer list and identify the broader market segment they should focus on for their business. The dashboard will provide insights and recommendations based on data analysis, helping the client make informed decisions about their marketing and sales strategies.

**Using Visualizations to present insights**  
  To make a visualization created a dashboard using google data studio that displays the data summary and result of the analysis. Some of the context when presenting findings are
      1. Total Bike Purchase by men and women
      2. Past purchases related to Customer
      3. Past purchases related to industry
      4. Top 10 customers to focus on future
